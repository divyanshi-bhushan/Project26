# Best red velvet cake

 The most incredible red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting! fluffy, soft, buttery and moist with the most perfect velvet texture!This red velvet cake has been adapted from The New York Times, with slight   adjustments to the ingredients and the addition of oil for an even  softer, richer and buttery melt-in-your-mouth cake. We tested a few versions with just butter, some with only oil, and some with half a dozen eggs! Truthfully, the one we are publishing is the best and received high praise from everyone who tried it. Both young and old!
